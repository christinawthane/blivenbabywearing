Sign & Play is a chance for you and your child to learn something new and meet other moms in the area. Enjoy some coffee, snacks and conversation while the kids play. You can ask questions you may have about signs for words that you use frequently in your home. At each session we will have a 15-20 minute ‘lesson’ with songs and props to learn new signs to a given theme. For dates and themes and to RSVP to a particular session, please see below. For special events and outings, check the [events page](/events).

Interested in learning basic signs that build on each other as you go? Sign up for one of our 4-week [Signing Time!](/signingtime) sessions.

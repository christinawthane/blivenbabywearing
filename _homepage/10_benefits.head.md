Babywearing has many advantages both for your child and for you. From a practical standpoint babywearing allows you to get things done around the house, cook, or read a book with both your hands free. At train stations you won’t be desperately searching for an elevator before your train leaves, and in shops you won’t worry about whether there are a couple steps leading in or whether the aisles are wide enough for your stroller.

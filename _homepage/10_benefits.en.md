Babywearing has many advantages both for your child and for you. From a practical standpoint babywearing allows you to get things done around the house, cook, or read a book with both your hands free. At train stations you won’t be desperately searching for an elevator before your train leaves, and in shops you won’t worry about whether there are a couple steps leading in or whether the aisles are wide enough for your stroller.

More importantly, though, it is a huge advantage to your baby’s development. Proper carrying supports healthy hip and spine development, increases successful breastfeeding, decreases postpartum depression, and encourages closeness, attachment, and bonding.

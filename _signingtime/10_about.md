Signing Time! was developed by Rachel Coleman in 2006. She found out that her own young daughter Leah was deaf and not only learned American Sign Language (ASL) herself, but taught Leahâ€™s classmates and family so they could communicate with her. That turned into videos and songs to help children and their parents learn to communicate.

Christine Bliven is excited to be the first Signing Time! instructor in Switzerland.

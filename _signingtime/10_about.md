Signing Time was developed by Rachel Coleman in 2006. She found out that her own young daughter Leah was deaf and not only learned American Sign Language (ASL) herself, but taught Leahâ€™s classmates and family so they could communicate with her. That turned into videos and songs to help children and their parents learn to communicate.

Baby Signing Time! Classes are meant to be a fun way for parents to connect with their babies and meet other parents in the area. We will read stories and sing songs that will help us learn some signs. These basic signs can be used with your children at home to encourage communication. Classes are offered in two locations as well as morning and afternoon options to accommodate your schedule.

Christine Bliven is excited to be the first Signing Time instructor in Switzerland.

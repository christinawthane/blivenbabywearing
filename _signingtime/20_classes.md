Baby Signing Time! Classes are meant to be a fun way for parents to connect with their babies and meet other parents in the area. We will read stories and sing songs that will help us learn some signs. These basic signs can be used with your children at home to encourage communication. Classes are offered in two locations as well as morning and afternoon options to accommodate your schedule.

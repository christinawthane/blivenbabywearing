Babies use their hands to communicate before they speak. They can point and wave, so why not add to their vocabulary? Using sign language can help your baby communicate their needs even before they can speak. For toddlers it can help ease some of those tantrums that come from not being able to express their needs. Learn a new way to communicate with your child and have fun while doing it! Learn over 70 signs in one semester.

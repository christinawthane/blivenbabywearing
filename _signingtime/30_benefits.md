Babies use their hands to communicate before they speak. They can point and wave, so why not add to their vocabulary? Using sign language can help your baby communicate their needs even before they can speak. For toddlers it can help ease some of those tantrums that come from not being able to express their needs and it's a fun new skill for you to learn together. Learn a new way to communicate with your child and have fun while doing it! Learn over 70 signs in one semester.

The class is recommended for kids from 4 months to 4 years old. If your child is younger or older, send me a message to see whether it might still be a good fit!

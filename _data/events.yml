# Syntax:
#
# Each class section starts with a -. It must be all the way to the left.
# INDENTATION IS IMPORTANT FOR YML FILES.
# The properties of each class should be indented with two spaces so they line up.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and are ignored, so you can add notes to
# yourself. Blank lines are ignored too.
#
# The label is important, since it will be the only indication you get for
# which class the person registered for. They need to be unique. Leaving it
# blank gives a good default.

    Baby Signing Time (BST) 1 covers basic signs such as food and family that will be most useful at home. I recommend you take this class first. BST 2 covers signs that are probably less used, but still useful, such as clothes and transportation signs. I recommend you take this class after taking BST 1, but that is not required. If the scheduling works out better for you to take it in the opposite order, please feel free to do so.

    Join us on Saturday, July 13th for an outing to the Zürich Zoo to learn
    signs for various zoo animals. This is a great chance to show your child the
    sign right next to the real thing rather than just a picture. Please get
    your own entrance ticket (there are no additional costs for this event) and
    meet us by the (fake) penguins just inside the gates. We will make a loop
    through the zoo and learn signs for the animals as we see them. Our Friday
    Sign & Play session will be zoo themed, so if you would like to get some
    practice ahead of time, join us then to learn some of the animal signs in
    advance.

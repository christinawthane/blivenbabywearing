# Current signing time classes
#
# Syntax:
#
# Each class section starts with a -. It must be all the way to the left.
# INDENTATION IS IMPORTANT FOR YML FILES.
# The properties of each class should be indented with two spaces so they line up.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and are ignored, so you can add notes to
# yourself. Blank lines are ignored too.
#
# The label is important, since it will be the only indication you get for
# which class the person registered for. They need to be unique. Leaving it
# blank gives a good default.
#
# Descriptions can contain markdown. Use two newlines to start a new paragraph.
#
# Properties:
#  class: Class name. 'signingtime' or 'signandplay'

#     Sign & Play is a chance for you and your child to learn something new and meet other moms in the area. Enjoy some coffee, snacks and conversation while the kids play. You can ask questions you may have about signs for words that you use frequently in your home. At each session we will have a 15-20 minute ‘lesson’ with songs and props to learn new signs to a given theme.


#     This week’s theme is 4th of July/USA. We will cover words like America, fireworks, and freedom. Have suggestions for other words to this theme that you’d like to know? Let me know on [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/LilyBeeZurich/) or
#     [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/LilyBeeZurich/) and I’ll make sure they’re included!

#    Bundle up and put your baby in a sling or stroller and come for a walk with

#    have your coffee/tea while it's still hot! We'll meet at 9:30am every
#    Saturday in February at Bucheggplatz and go for a walk that should take
#    1-1.5 hours (depending on our littlest/slowest walkers). Looking forward to
#    seeing you then!

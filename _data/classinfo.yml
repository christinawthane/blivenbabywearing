  description: >-
    Bundle up and put your baby in a sling or stroller and come for a walk with
    other moms and dads.  Bring your husbands and older kids, mine will be
    there. Or send your husband with the kids and put your feet up at home and
    have your coffee/tea while it's still hot! We'll meet at 9:30am every
    Saturday in February at Bucheggplatz and go for a walk that should take
    1-1.5 hours (depending on our littlest/slowest walkers). Looking forward to
    seeing you then!

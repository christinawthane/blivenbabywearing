# Current signing time classes
#
# Syntax:
#
# Each class section starts with a -. It must be all the way to the left.
# The properties of each class should be indented with two spaces so they line up.
# Lines starting with '#' are comments and are ignored, so you can add notes to
# yourself. Blank lines are ignored too.
#
# The label is important, since it will be the only indication you get for
# which class the person registered for. They need to be unique. Leaving it
# blank gives a good default.
#
# Properties:
# - class: currently 'signingtime'. Included for other future class types
# - title: name of the class (optional)
# - dayofweek: Plural day of the week (Tuesdays)
# - time: Time range
# - dates: Date range
# - location: Either 'schwamendingen' or 'wipkingen'
# - label: label to include in submitted form to identify this class. If ommitted, generated from other info.
# - cancelled: set to 'true' to mark the class as being cancelled

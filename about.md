My name is Christine Bliven. I was born in Zürich and lived here
nine years before moving to the US (Seattle area) with my family.
My father is American and my mother is Swiss. I studied Psychology
and received a Master’s degree before following my heart (now
husband) to San Diego, California. There I continued my studies and
completed a Certificate in Infant Preschool Mental Health. After
several years in sunny California my husband and I decided to move
to Zürich for a year or two as he finished up his Phd. Four years
later we are still here and have two lovely kids.

Babywearing: We were given a wrap before my son was born and my
husband wore him home from the birth house. We continued to
babywear and found that my son loved it and it was really
convenient for us. As I got more involved with the babywearing
community I realized that there weren’t any consultants who
provided consultations mainly in English. Many can speak English
and do a fantastic job consulting in English, but their websites
are in German and so it’s difficult for expats to find them. So
with some encouragement from a good friend who is also a
consultant, I took the training at the [ClauWi](http://clauwi.ch/) school and became a
babywearing consultant myself. Now I consult both in German and in
English and I love helping new moms find ways to be closer to their
babies and simultaneously find time for themselves.

Signing: I’ve loved American Sign Language (ASL) for as long as I
can remember. I watched in awe as the interpreter at our church
interpreted the songs with beautiful motions. I took a class at a
community college in San Diego and then when my work schedule
wouldn’t allow me to continue I found a one-on-one Deaf tutor who
continued to teach me the language. We found an amazing Deaf
community and were able to learn not only about the language but
about the culture. Once we moved to Switzerland I took a beginners
sign language class in German sign language. It was interesting to
see the similarities and differences between that and ASL. I’ve had
experience using sign language with my own kids and noticed not
only that they can use it to communicate before they speak, but
also that they enjoy it. By teaching baby signing classes I am
hoping to pass this joy on to other families with young
children.

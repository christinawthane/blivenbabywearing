<dl class="faq">
<dt>My partner and I are happy together. Do we need this course?</td>
<dd>Yes! The workshop is intended for typical couples who are recent or soon-to-be parents. You will get tools and tips on how to maintain your friendship and strengthen your bond with each other and your baby. If you already have a solid relationship many of the exercises may come easier to you, but you will also learn about new tools to add to your tool belt and we will address relationship issues specifically how they relate to being new parents.</dd>

<dt>My partner and I are looking for counseling and considering separation, is this course for us?</dt>
<dd>No, this course is not couple’s therapy. If you and your partner have serious issues you would like to work out I encourage you to seek out a qualified therapist for couple’s therapy. A group setting like this is not the appropriate place to work through significant relationship issues.</dd>

<dt>Will the course cover childbirth or infant care?</dt>
<dd>No, those are outside the scope of Gottmann Bringing Baby Home. This is a class focused on the couple’s relationship after having a baby and working to strengthen that foundation for the sake of the entire family unit.</dd>

<dt>Do both partners need to attend?</dt>
<dd>Yes, both partners should be available for all sessions.</dt>

<dt>What is the refund/cancellation policy?</dt>
<dd>
Full refunds are available for cancellations more than 14 days before the start of the course. Within 14 days the full course amount will be charged.

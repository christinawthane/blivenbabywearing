Two-thirds of new parents report a decline in marital satisfaction after the birth of
a baby. The added stress and time commitment, the lack of sleep, and the change in
identity that comes with parenthood can challenge even the most solid relationships.
So how can we be part of the other third who donâ€™t experience a decline, or are even
more satisfied than before baby?

In this workshop we will discuss research-based tools you can use to maintain and
strengthen your relationship amidst the transition of becoming a family. We will look
at red flags to watch out for and how to counteract them.

The quality of your relationship is key to the happiness and wellbeing of your
children. Investing the time to strengthen your friendship will have a significant
positive impact not only on your relationship, but also on the relationship between
you and your baby.

This workshop is for couples expecting a baby or who have had a baby within the last
three years. Babies in arms (not mobile, up to 6 months) are welcome. We will happily
accommodate time to feed, change, pump, etc. throughout the course. Snacks and drinks
are provided.

- Consultations take place at Lilybee in Wipkingen or [Gut Betucht](http://www.gut-betucht.ch/) in Schwamendingen. For an extra fee I will come to your house as well. 
- You can make an appointment for a consultation while you are still pregnant or once your baby has already arrived. See the different options [here](#consulting_en).
- If possible, schedule a time when both parents can come to the consultation. If one parent is working,  and grandma is interested in wearing the baby when she babysits, bring her instead! In the interest of time, two is the maximum number of people per consultation. If you’d like to bring more, please contact me so we can arrange something.
- Make the appointment for a day when your baby does not have other appointments. Scheduling it after a doctor’s appointment or a morning playdate can be overwhelming for your little one and we want him to be relaxed as much as possible.
- Don’t worry about her feeding schedule, you can feed and change your baby as needed throughout the consultation - we’re flexible!
- Bring your baby. Ideally she would be wearing separate onsie and pants rather than pajamas with feet, as those can restrict movement in a wrap.

## First-time Consultation (1.5-2 hours)

*120.-*

Learn the theory behind babywearing, including important information about what to look for while carrying your baby so that he is well supported and comfortable. We will look at different wraps and carriers depending on your needs and preferences and the baby’s age. You will get a chance to practice the new techniques with a special weighted doll before trying it out with your baby. After the consultation you may rent one or more wraps or carriers to try out at home if you like.

## Follow-up Consultation

*60.-/hour*

Learn to carry on your back with a wrap or a carrier, experiment with different lengths or types of wraps, or bring your friend or partner to refresh and go over what you learned.

## Pregnancy Consultation (1 hour before birth, 1.5 hours after baby arrives)

*175.-*

The first consultation takes place before the baby is here. We will go over different techniques and options so that you get a feel for what is out there. If you would like to wear your baby right away this is a good chance to explore different types of wraps and carriers so you can make an informed decision about purchasing something in preparation for your baby’s arrival. You will learn the theory behind babywearing and what is important in carrying your baby in an ergonomically supportive way. We will practice with a special weighted doll and have plenty of time for questions. After Baby is born we will arrange a second consultation where Baby will come along. We will revisit what was learned in the first consultation and try these techniques out with your baby. We can make adjustments based on the baby’s preferences and your comfort.
